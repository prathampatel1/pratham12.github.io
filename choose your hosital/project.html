<h3>Kaiser Medical Group </h3>
<p>The organization's goals are "to bring the benefits of modern medical science to those most in need of them and to serve as an antidote to despair." It provides healthcare in the poorest areas of developing countries. It builds hospitals and other medical facilities, hires and trains local staff, and delivers a range of healthcare, from in-home consultations to cancer treatments. Founded in 1959 as Presbyterian Intercommunity Hospital, it has been managed by the nonprofit InterHealth Corporation since the mid-1980s. The organization changed its name to PIH Health in 2012. PIH Health also operates PIH Health Hospital - Downey which was formerly known as Downey Regional Medical Center. PIH Health operates an office in Uptown Whittier, and several other medical offices elsewhere in the region that were formerly branded as Bright Medical. PIH Health is the largest employer in Whittier, and one of the largest in that region of Los Angeles County.</p>
